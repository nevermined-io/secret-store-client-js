## Introduction

This client abstracts the interface of the [Parity Secret Store](https://wiki.parity.io/Secret-Store) to just two methods `encryptDocument` and `decryptDocument`. It uses a local parity node to sign the generation of keys and stores them remotely into an instance of the secret store.

## Get started

Start by adding the package to your dependencies:

```bash
npm i @nevermined-io/secret-store-client
```

### Usage

To get a new instance of SecretStore do the following:

```ecmascript 6
import SecretStore from "@nevermined-io/secret-store-client"

const secretStore = new SecretStore({
    secretStoreUri: "https://secret-store.dev-nevermined.com", 
    parityUri: "http://localhost:8545",
    address: "0xed243adfb84a6626eba46178ccb567481c6e655d",
    password: "unittest",
    threshold: 2,
})
```

To encrypt a document do the following:

```ecmascript 6
const testDocument = {
    so: "nevermined",
    soWow: true,
}

// generate random 64 digit numerical id
const serverKeyId = generateRandomId()
/* this will:
 * - sign the given serverKeyId with the private key from the given address (unlocked with given password)
 * - generate a server key based in the given serverKeyId
 * - generate a document key derived from the server key
 * - store the document key in secret store
 * - encrypt the document and return it
 */
const encryptedDocument = await secretStore.encryptDocument(serverKeyId, testDocument)
```

To decrypt a document do the following:

```ecmascript 6
/* this will:
 * - sign the given serverKeyId with the private key from the given address (unlocked with given password)
 * - retrieve the document key from secret store
 * - decrypt the document and return it
 */
const decryptedDocument = await secretStore.decryptDocument(serverKeyId, encryptedDocument)
```

Now both documents are the same:

```ecmascript 6
assert(testDocument.so === decryptedDocument.so)
```

## Development

To start development you need to:

```bash
npm i
npm start
```

### Testing

Testing needs a local instance of parity client and secret store. You can spin up these services using [nevermined-io/tools](https://github.com/nevermined-io/tools):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nevermined-io/tools
cd barge
bash -x start_nevermined.sh --latest --local-spree-node 2>&1 > start_nevermined.log &
```

To start test you need to:

```bash
npm run test
```

To run a single testsuite `ParityClient` for example:

```bash
npm run test -- -g "ParityClient"
```

To watch tests

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

This will start a watcher for changes of the code.

To create code coverage
```bash
npm run test:cover
```

### Documentation

To create code documentation
```bash
npm run doc
```

### Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

### npm releases

For a new **patch release**, execute on the machine where you're logged into your npm account:

```bash
npm run release
```

In case you have 2FA setup on npm.js, pass a code as One Time Password:

```bash
npm run release --otp <yourcode>
```

Command is powered by [`release-it`](https://github.com/webpro/release-it) package, defined in the `package.json`.

That's what the command does without any user interaction:

- create release commit by updating version in `package.json`
- create tag for that release commit
- push commit & tag
- create a new release on GitHub, with change log auto-generated from commit messages
- publish to npm as a new release

If you want to create a **minor** or **major release**, use these commands:

```bash
npm run release-minor
```

```bash
npm run release-major
```
